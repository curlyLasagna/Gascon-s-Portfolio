I'm very grateful for this opportunity. I've learned so much more in my first 2 weeks than I ever could have if I spent a month studying the same topics on my own.

I've always looked forward to the onboarding process. That's one thing I believe I excel at because of all the ricing I've done in the past with my Linux setups. I was given a MacBook M2 Pro as a work laptop, so I was pretty comfortable with the operating system and even tried to setup [home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) but I wanted to make a good impression and hit the ground running.

The part of the onboarding process that was a mystery to me at first was Docker and how the entire local development environment worked.
We use a docker-compose script that spins up the different services, the database, and the gateway. I was impressed at this level of engineering since I hadn't seen something spin up like this before.  

The first story that I was assigned to was creating a Python script that renames each document of a Mongo database property to something else. It was a simple task since I'm most comfortable with Python.

## Learning how to write test ðŸ¥²

The second story I picked up for myself was a bit more challenging than my first one. The team was in the process of rewriting the majority of their backend. I was able to read through the code base at a good pace. I eventually finished implementing the required values to return and got the expected values when calling the route through Postman. I felt accomplished! It wasn't until I had to write unit and e2e test that tested my patience.   

## Conclusion


Overall, I learned these things: 

- What difference a good system design does    
- The number of technologies involved
