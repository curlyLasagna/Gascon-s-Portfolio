I've hosted workshops for the software engineering club at my university using org mode with RevealJs.

## Workshops

- [Markup](https://github.com/curlyLasagna/Markup-Workshop)
- [Terminal](https://github.com/curlyLasagna/Terminal_Workshop)
- [Static Sites](https://github.com/curlyLasagna/Static-Site-Workshop)

Creating a power point presentation felt boring and generic. I wanted to be extra.

In search of alternatives, I required the following features:

- Code blocks
- Math typesetting

Beamer is a possibility but I'd rather org than $\LaTeX$

Since the end product is a static site, I can host it with GitHub pages so the audience can go look through the slides at their own pace.

But I have to be honest, this process takes up more time than using PowerPoint but I need an excuse to visit my good old friend Emacs.

While I was configuring my Doom Emacs configuration, I ran into the `+present` flag for `org` with the following description:

> A configuration for using org-mode for slide-show presentations or exporting org files to reveal.js slideshows

I was already aware of the power of Emacs, but I was intrigued as to how it's able to create a presentation

If you don't use Doom Emacs, you'll have to install [org-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal)

```
(org +present)
```

Under:
>Enable integration with reveal.js, beamer and org-tree-slide, so Emacs can be
 used for presentations. It automatically downloads [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

As someone who's constantly trying to justify the use of Emacs, this was the perfect opportunity.

## The process

I'm going to assume you know how to push to a git repo and set remotes

- I create a directory for the presentation and initialize a git repo
- Create an org file named `index.org`

### Headers

```org
:REVEAL_PROPERTIES:
#+REVEAL_ROOT: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js
#+REVEAL_REVEAL_JS_VERSION: 4
#+REVEAL_PLUGINS: (notes highlight zoom)
#+REVEAL_THEME: white
#+REVEAL_TRANS: linear
:END:
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil timestamp:nil author:nil
#+TITLE: <insert title>
```

### Exporting to HTML

- I invoke `org-export-dispatch` (`<C-c C-e>` for you non-evil doers ðŸ˜‡) and select the right options
- This generates an HTML file named `index.html`

### Hosting on GitHub pages

Push to main :)
See this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) on publishing your presentation as a static site.

## Conclusion

I really like the look of the slides. I don't enjoy the process of coming up with a layout for my slides and this methodology just checks off a lot of boxes for me.

I still do use PowerPoint and Google Slides for the features they provide such as PowerPoint's AI-powered Designer.
