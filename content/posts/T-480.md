I bought a Lenovo T-480 during my Fall 2023 semester in the hopes that I can convince myself that I can sell my MacBook M1 Pro 14" and be content with the T-480.

This [article](https://maxrozen.com/replacing-my-macbook-m1-with-thinkpad-t480) is a good article that I was able to relate before I started shoping around.

What finalized my decision in buying a T-480 was winning a bid for it for a pretty sweet deal of only $149.5 + $18.95 shipping. 

The laptop came in really good shape. There was no a single cosmetic flaw other than the Windows sticker üòÅ

## Impressions

### Battery Life

For an older x86 machine and with batteries close to around 80% of its maximum capacity, it holds up surprisingly well.

I didn't really do anything extensive on the machine other than compiling Emacs in WSL.

### Trackpad

The trackpad doesn't feel good at all, especially scrolling. 

The plastic was not pleasant to touch and I would've preferred a glass surface. I'm aware of the glass trackpad upgrade, but it was hard to find a source when I had did have it.

What I've found that works for me was using the track point to scroll since I didn't have to rub my fingers all over the trackpad and it felt pretty ergonomic

### Keyboard

Although the switch travel is higher than the Macbook, subjectively, it just didn't have a similar tactile satisfaction that I'm used to with the MacBook.

### Performance

I can see the sluggishness catching up to this laptop when I'd watch a YouTube video. I don't mind it but it's going to bother me when I'm locked in and frantically switching around windows and tabs.

This machine could definitely 

### Speakers

The speakers were an afterthought. Vocals are just hard to understand. Music shouldn't be played out of these speakers.

### Display

I can't pinpoint whether it's the size of the screen or the colors but I got a headache after looking at it for less than an hour.

I'm not a fan of matte screens. It doesn't look like glass, it looks more plastic to me. I find that it didn't help with glares, it just smeared it.

If I can find a legitimate source for the coveted 400-nit N140HCG-GQ2 display, then I'll think about getting it replaced. The colors are so dull.

## Operating System of Choice

### Windows 11

I wanted to see what new things came with Windows 11. I love the inclusion of Windows Terminal.

WSL is a godsend for development

### Linux

#### Arch

I did it for the memes and I also miss the setup process. I mained Arch for over a year a long time ago.

I had `tlp` installed. With the following changes:
- CPU energy performance policy on battery = `balance_performance`
- CPU turbo disabled

I can't recall why I switched out of Arch but I was experimenting with Wayland based tiling window managers like sway.

#### Fedora

I eventually settled with Fedora-39.
Customizing Linux has been a blast but it's not a good use of my time.
I had to focus on school.

## Upgrades

I bought a 16GB 2400mhz stick for the 2nd RAM slot. I doubt I'll ever use all 24GB unless I'm running multiple docker containers.
The 8GB sticks were about $12 cheaper, but I don't mind paying that extra amount for another 8GB

# Selling it

I ended up selling my MacBook to a co-worker who was looking for a laptop.

Although this laptop was perfectly capable for my needs, the battery life and display were a contributing factor to me going back to the Macbook that I initially wanted to sell.

I can deal with Windows and its differences but Apple has completely ruined my standards for a laptop.

I'll miss the track point though.

I wish I took down more detailed notes about my whole experience with it.
