I'm still a huge fan of Emacs and will try to use it as much as possible.

I used Doom Emacs for 2 semesters and religiously used it. I eventually transitioned to my own Emacs config.

After spending countless hours trying to configure my Emacs config for web development, I realized I was putting myself at a disadvantage with all the time I wasted trying to emulate VsCode's functionality.

Ever since I started using VsCode as a means of making income, I've been in love with it. Mentally, it allows me to focus on getting work done. Changing themes for fun does get distracting from time to time.

## Favorite plugins

### [Project Manager](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-project-manager)

I love being able to jump around different projects. With only a single window, I can work on a front-end project and quickly jump over to the back-end in just a snap

### VSpaceCode

The keybindings that come with this extension make VsCode a walk in the park to navigate. You don't need to have the Vim emulation plugin to use this extension, but allows it to work right out of the box.

This extension comes with [Which Key](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSpaceCode.whichkey), so you get a nice little pop-up to reference.

### Vim

My journey with terminal-based text editors started with Vim when I was daily driving a laptop on Arch Linux. For a semester, I tested out Emacs keybinds but I'm taking my Vim motions with me to the grave.

It covers most of the motions that I know of, but it has its quirks  

### LaTeX Workshop

I love making documents with LaTeX  

### Markdown Preview Enhanced

Markdown to PDF at a speed of light!

## Favorite functionalities/hotkeys

### Search Symbol

`cmd+shift+o`

Want to search for a function and only a function?

This feature beats `cmd+f` any day and what allows me to efficiently jump around

### Jump to char

This is functionality is part of the Vim plugin

### Select project file

`cmd+p` to jump to any files in the project
