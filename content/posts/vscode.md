I was a diehard Emacs user. I used Doom Emacs for 2 semesters and religiously used it. I even used my own custom Emacs config. I took the time to learn Emacs key-binds and emacs lisp. Learning Emacs lisp came in very handy in my programming languages course, because we used Emacs lisp.

Ever since I started using VsCode at my current position, I've been in love with it. I was able to focus solely on my work. Changing themes for fun do get distracting from time to time.

## Favorite plugins

### [Project Manager](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-project-manager)

I love being able to jump around different projects. With only a single window, I can work on a front-end project and quickly jump over to the back-end if I believe an error 

### VSpaceCode

The keybindings that come with this extension makes VsCode a walk in the park to navigate. You don't need to have the Vim emulation plugin to use this extension, but it does make it easy.

This extension comes with [Which Key](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSpaceCode.whichkey), so you get a nice little pop-up for reference.

### Vim

My journey with terminal-based text editors started with Vim when I was daily driving a laptop on Arch Linux. For a semester, I tested out Emacs keybinds but my Vim motions will stay with me to the grave. It's just so comfortable.
