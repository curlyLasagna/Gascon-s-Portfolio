## About

The parking garage shared between the science complex and the math/computer science building in my university currently doesn't have a system to inform students that there are no parking spots available. I've fallen victim to circling around the parking lot to find a potential spot or parking at a different parking garage where I have to walk a bit further.

In my Artificial Intelligence course, our final project was to come up with a problem and solution involving, of course, artificial intelligence.
