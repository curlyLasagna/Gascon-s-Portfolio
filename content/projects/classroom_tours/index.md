I created this project for my software engineering course for Fall 2023

## Problem it tries to solve

I worked as a classroom technology assistant at the time of developement and one of my responsibilities was to maintain a department website called the "Virtual Tour", which has a namespace conflict with an existing "Virtual Tour" that showcases the university interactively. With that in mind, let's call my department's virtual tour, CCLT tour

The CCLT tour is a comprehensive static website detailing the A/V technology-equipped rooms at Towson University, including features like projectors and ceiling microphones. 

This resource provides essential information for understanding the audiovisual capabilities of each classroom ahead of time.

The pages of this static site are generated by a Visual Basic program that performs the following:
- Database calls to get the list of equipment and other metadata about the room such as the number of seats and whether it has wireless display functionality
- Generates an HTML page for each directory

This project is intended as a rewrite of the CCLT tour website to remedy its limitations

## Tech Stack

| Stack    | Name          |
|----------|---------------|
| Frontend | Astro & React |
| Styling  | TailwindCSS   |
| Backend  | Supabase      |

### Supabase

This is the first time I've ever heard of BaaS (backend as a service)

Initially, I was worried I was going to spend a considerable amount of time architecturing and implementing the backend. 

Supabase provides a Javascript SDK for the front-end that allows the front-end to easily communicate with the back-end.

### Astro


## Use of AI

This sounds like a push by the CS department at my school, but one of the requirements of this project was to have AI in our projects somehow. 

I've opted to use Hugging Face's inference API for a Q&A bot. 

## Future Developments

Although this project has been submitted and graded, I'd like to see this project completed.

The list are features I'd like to add to this project
