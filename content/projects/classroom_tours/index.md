I created this project for my software engineering course for Fall 2023

## Problem it tries to solve

I worked as a classroom technology assistant at this time and one of my responsibilities was to add content to a department website called the "Virtual Tour", which has a namespace conflict with an existing "Virtual Tour" that showcases the university interactively. Let's call my department's virtual tour, CCLT tour

CCLT tour is a static site that contains information about all of the rooms at Towson University that contains classroom A/V technology such as projectors and ceiling microphones. 

The pages of this static site are generated by a Visual Basic program that performs the following:
- Database calls to get the list of equipment and other metadata about the room such as the number of seats and whether it has wireless display functionality
- Generates an HTML page for each directory

This project is intended as a rewrite of the CCLT tour website to remedy its limitations

## Tech Stack

I was still unfamiliar with the domain of web development, but I always hear about these cool Javascript frameworks, such as Svelte, and Astro. I've tried creating something out of Svelte and SvelteKit once, but that project lost traction really fast.

| Frontend | Astro       |
| Styling  | TailwindCSS |
| Backend  | Supabase    |

### Supabase

I've never worked with a BaaS (Backend as a service) before but wow does it do a lot of heavy lifting.

Thankfully, Supabase provides a Javascript SDK to communicate with the
