# Purpose

As a commuter who has to drive an hour to get to my school, I opt to stay in campus for the rest of the day to make the most out of my drive. This means coming up with things to do while I'm in campus before boredom strikes. I'm a bit of an extrovert and someone who enjoys free food, so I always look for events to participate.

Towson University has 2 sources of events:

- [involved](https://involved.towson.edu/events)
- [events](https://events.towson.edu/).

There is also [Handshake](https://towson.joinhandshake.com/stu/events?collection=ALL&eventFormat=HYBRID&sort=RELEVANCE&date=ALL) but I need auth to get anything from their GraphQL endpoint and I figured it's not worth the effort.

## Development Process

Taking what I've learned from my time at SecurEd, I introduced my team with the software development process of feature branches.
Fortunately, I had a team member who's familiar with the procress I had in mind.

Anyone can create an issue. We try to be as descriptive as much as possible, but the majority of the details are shared through conversations in our Slack channel. We don't assign anyone any specific issue, it's whoever assigns themselves first.

### Branching

I've always struggled with coming up with branch names, but GitHub generates a branch name based on the issue number and the title, which I've found sufficient enough.

### Code Review

Whenever they believe they're finished with the task, team mates push branch with their changes. A pull request is created and the other team members review the code
